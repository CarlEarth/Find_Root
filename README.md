# Find_Root
Find the root of the function set in the code

This code uses the bisection method to find the root
as continuous function f on the interval [a, b],
where f (a) and f (b) have opposite signs.

The original algorithm is from the Numerical Analysis written by 
Richard L.Burden and J. Douglas Faires.
